üìÇ Structure of My GitHub
Here are some of the key projects that I have worked on:

1.  C programming
Purpose:
Algorithmic Thinking: Students learn to approach problems methodically, breaking down tasks and optimizing solutions.
Unix/Linux Systems: Mastering the command line, threads, file I/O, scripting, and system tools in a Unix-based environment is critical.
Version Control: Using tools like Git to manage code and collaborate effectively.
Peer Learning: 42 places a strong emphasis on learning from peers, working on projects together, and giving/receiving feedback.

Projects:
Circle 0: Libft
Circle 1: ft_printf, get_next_line
Circle 2: Push_swap, so_long, pipex
Circle 3: Philosophers, Minishell !!
Circle 4: Cub3D

So, alongside C programming, the early curriculum focuses on building a strong foundation in algorithms, system fundamentals, and collaboration skills.

2. C++ Programming:
Purpose: Learn some advance features
In C++, you'll encounter several key concepts that build on the foundations of C. Here are some of the main topics and features you‚Äôll learn:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation,
2. Standard Template Library (STL): Containers, Iterators, Algorithms
3. Memory Management Dynamic Memory Allocation, Smart Pointers
4. Advanced Features: Templates, Exception Handling
5. Operator Overloading

Projects:
Circle 4: C01-C04
Circle 5: C05-C09, Webserv!!

3. ft_transcendence
Now, foundation is done. It's first time to flight.
The purpose of transcendence is to elevate one's skills and understanding beyond the basics, enabling deeper mastery and greater success in both personal and professional realms.

It's time for:
1. Deep Learning
Transcendence encourages students to not just memorize code or concepts but to understand the underlying principles, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
2. Adaptability
By transcending foundational knowledge, students become more adaptable and capable of tackling new technologies and challenges as they arise.
3. Creativity
This approach promotes creativity and innovation, encouraging students to think outside the box and develop unique solutions to complex problems.
4. Collaboration and Peer Learning
Transcendence often involves collaboration with peers, helping students learn from each other and develop strong teamwork skills, which are crucial in the tech industry.
5. Personal Growth
It emphasizes personal development, pushing students to improve not only their technical skills but also their soft skills, resilience, and ability to learn independently.
6. Lifelong Learning
Finally, transcendence instills a mindset of lifelong learning, preparing students for continuous growth in their careers and adapting to an ever-evolving technological landscape.

And as the start point, we develop our full-stack website!!!!
Technologies: Ruby / Django (Python), HTML/CSS (Bootstrap toolkit), Javascript, Docker, ... etc. Now, just little Litmit.

Other Course:
Python0-4: We have Piscine Python again!
