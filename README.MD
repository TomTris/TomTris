## üìÇ Structure of My GitHub

Here are some of the key projects that I have worked on:

### 1. C Programming
**Purpose:**
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Learn to approach problems methodically, breaking down tasks and optimizing solutions.
- **Unix/Linux Systems**: Master the command line, threads, file I/O, scripting, and system tools in a Unix-based environment.
- **Version Control**: Use tools like Git to manage code and collaborate effectively.
- **Peer Learning**: Emphasize learning from peers, working on projects together, and giving/receiving feedback.

**Projects:**
- **Circle 0**: Libft
- **Circle 1**: ft_printf, get_next_line
- **Circle 2**: Push_swap, so_long, pipex
- **Circle 3**: Philosophers, Minishell
- **Circle 4**: Cub3D

So, alongside C programming, the early curriculum focuses on building a strong foundation in algorithms, system fundamentals, and collaboration skills.

### 2. C++ Programming
**Purpose**: Learn some advanced features.

In C++, you'll encounter several key concepts that build on the foundations of C. Here are some of the main topics and features you‚Äôll learn:
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
2. **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Containers, Iterators, Algorithms
3. **Memory Management**: Dynamic Memory Allocation, Smart Pointers
4. **Advanced Features**: Templates, Exception Handling
5. **Operator Overloading**

**Projects:**
- **Circle 4**: C01-C04
- **Circle 5**: C05-C09, Webserv

### 3. ft_transcendence
Now, foundation is done. It's time to take flight.

**Purpose of Transcendence**: To elevate one's skills and understanding beyond the basics, enabling deeper mastery and greater success in both personal and professional realms.

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Deep Learning**: Understand the underlying principles, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
2. **Adaptability**: Become more adaptable and capable of tackling new technologies and challenges.
3. **Creativity**: Promote innovation, encouraging unique solutions to complex problems.
4. **Collaboration and Peer Learning**: Learn from peers and develop strong teamwork skills.
5. **Personal Growth**: Improve technical skills, soft skills, resilience, and independent learning.
6. **Lifelong Learning**: Instill a mindset of continuous growth and adaptation to the evolving technological landscape.

**Projects**: Developing a full-stack website!
- **Circle 6**: C01-C04

- **Technologies**: Ruby, Django (Python), HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, Docker, etc.

### Other Courses
-  **Circle 1**: Born2beroot: First Administration inside a virtual Maschine!
-  **Circle 3**: Net Practice: We learn about Networking and Subnet!
-  **Circle 4**: Inception: Learn how to use docker, containers with docker compose!
-  **Optional after Circle 5**: We have Piscine Python, our own Piscine again! (recommend to take it before start ft_transcendence)
